# AGENTS.md

## Project Instructions
- Always update `tasks.md` after completing any task.
- After updating `tasks.md`, explicitly confirm with the user that the task is complete.
- Prefer small, incremental changes with clear summaries.
- Avoid large refactors unless requested.
- Keep UI changes aligned with the existing visual language.
- For any auth or security changes, call out risks and require user confirmation.

## Workflow
1) Understand the request.
2) Make changes.
3) Update `tasks.md`.
4) Confirm completion with the user.
